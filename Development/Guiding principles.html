<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>What follows are some principles I've found useful as I try to discover my place in the world. Jesus says in John 10:10, "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have live, and have it to the full." Jesus wants us to be full of life in every sense of the word, but that life will only come hard-won from the Opposer. These are my observations as I try to figure out the rules of the game. They're written for a Christian audience; non-Christians may not find them useful.</p>

	<h1>Life is Conflict</h1>
	<h3>What kind of person do you want to be?</h3>

	<h1>Honesty is Fundamental</h1>
	<p><strong>He who deceives others deceives himself.</strong> A big part of becoming an effective person is understanding the world as it really is. The world is complicated and hard to figure out; you will have to work at uncovering the truth. To do that, you must stop believing the lies others tell you (intentionally or not) and put an end to the lies you tell yourself.</p>
	<p>This is difficult, because the purpose of a lie is usually to make things more comfortable for the liar. Switch to truth-only communications is going to be awkward, uncomfortable, and sometimes painful. And that's just when dealing with other people; the lies we cherish the most are the ones we tell ourselves. You can start a good habit right now by asking yourself: Am I willing to tell myself the truth even when it hurts? Even if the answer is "no", you've just admitted something important to yourself, which is a good start!</p>

<div class="principle">
	<h1>Embrace Complexity</h1>
	<p>Humans are phenomenally good at finding patterns. It's one of the few information-processing tasks we're still better at than computers. Unfortunately, our brains are so thoroughly wired around finding patterns that we often perceive patterns where none actually exist, and we get emotionally attached to patterns we consider desirable. This is a big root cause of faulty and often hurtful thinking.</p>
	<p>On some deep, instictual level, humans <em>really</em> want to believe the world makes sense. And not just on a broad scale; everything that happens needs to fit into some meaningful narrative, or we feel that something is wrong. This is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> comes from, along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming">victim blaming</a> and other fallacies.</p>
	<p>Every person carries a tiny, emotional model of the universe inside their head. This model is a big part of who they are. Because the universe is big and complicated, we tend to simplify our models, and that can get us into trouble.</p>
	<div>Pick the group you like the least: [Democrats] [Republicans] [Gays] [Cisgenders] [Men] [Women] [The rich] [The poor] [Cats]</div>
	<p>Let's say you're watching TV and someone says or does something outrageous. (On TV, this happens a lot.) As part of processing this, you probably consider the source: Is this person a man or woman? Shabby or well-dressed? Democrat or Republican? Gay or straight? You analyze every category this person fits into and then adjust your opinion of those groups based on this person's behavior.</p>
	<p>But here's the problem: When you adjust your opinion of everyone in group X based on the actions of one person, your mental model of that group is probably not getting closer to reality. They didn't <em>all</em> do that thing; only one of them did. But you're not really viewing them as individual people; you're too far away for that. So you mash what you know about all Democrats into one big Proto-Democrat in your head and ascribe the actions of every Democrat you know to that person.</p>
	<p>Problem is, Democrats are a big group. They don't all agree with each other; often they work at cross-purposes. So when you mash all their actions together, the result is an incoherent mess. The only way to make sense of the result is to declare that Democrats are crazy.</p>
	<p>Spoiler alert: They're not crazy. Your mental model is wrong. The members of that group are individuals, not a collective; each of their actions seems quite reasonable from their perspective.</p>
	<p>So be careful about generalizing people into groups, and especially about any pejoratives you assign to those groups. When you get angry at [group], unless you know the people in that group very well, the thing you are angry at may have only a faint resemblance to the reality.</p>
