    <h1>Principles of Heroism</h1>
    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <div class="quote">
    	<p>You could settle for... an ordinary life. Or do you feel like you were meant for something better?</p>
    	<p>Something special?</p>

    <p>I love stories of heroism. I think most people do. The daring plan, the desperate final battle, the last-minute turnaround just when all seems lost--all that. These story elements remind us that what seems impossible might just be doable if the right people are willing to commit to it.</p>
    <p>Heroes are hard to find, almost by definition. But they never go away; every era has had its heroes. They never go away because the <em>need</em> for them never goes away. Entropy never gives up, and neither do those who serve it, so new heroes must arise or evil will prevail.</p>
    <p>This is no less true today than it was in King Arthur's time. <strong>Our world needs heroes</strong>--men and women of proven good character who are willing to put others' well-being above their own.</p>
    <p>I've decided to become one of these people. What follows is a set of principles I've developed to help me along the way.</p>
    <p>It took me a long time to figure out the role of the hero in modern society. When knights in shining armor first appeared, their garb was supremely practical, because brigands were threatening the innocents of the land, and the knights' job was to cut them down in personal combat. The idealized gunslingers of the Old West performed the same task. Today, conflicts are won not with swords or guns but with words, ideas, and hard work. The nature of the conflict has changed: In most areas, evil no longer threatens our bodies, so we turn instead to defeating the evil inside ourselves and encouraging others to do the same.</p>
    <h3>1. You Get Skill Points For Everything</h3>
    <p>Role-playing games have taught me a lot about heroism. One of their most important lessons is that you are in control of what kind of person you are. This is modeled with a simple rule: <strong>Whenever you do something, you get better at doing that thing.</strong></p>
    <p><em>So,</em> you think, <em>practice makes perfect?</em> Yes, but there's more to it than that. Everything you do gets you skill points in that activity <em>whether you want them or not,</em> and there's an <em>opportunity cost</em> when you choose to do one thing instead of another. Cheating, manipulating people, even whiling your time away doing nothing--all of these are activities you can sink skill points into. Skill points that probably could have been better spent elsewhere. Every one of us probably has a few skill points we wish we could re-spend.</p>
    <p>We can't get those points back, but the good news is your supply of skill points is limited only by your lifespan. There are a <em>lot</em> of things you can get good at, and you have lots of time to learn. Just be intentional about which skills you're earning points in. If there are two approaches to a problem, take the one that will give you the kind of skill points you want.</p>
    <h3>2. Life Is Conflict</h3>
    <p>If you don't want to live your life hiding from every problem that comes your way, you're going to need to spend some points in skills that will help you overcome those problems. When those problems show up, don't avoid them--<strong>confront</strong> the problems, overcome them, and take the skill points they grant. This is how you level up into a more capable person.</p>
    <p>Be warned: your obstacles will fight dirty. There are forces at work which would like you to remain downtrodden and powerless. Attempting to better yourself practically guarantees that resistance will materialize. You <strong>must</strong> push through it. Don't flinch when something makes you uncomfortable. Learn to recognize fear and overcome it. Accept pain when it leads to something good. Life and freedom await you on the other side.</p>
    <p>I'm not here to tell you it will be easy. It's not meant to be. Challenging ourselves by overcoming adversity is how character growth works. Nothing truly valuable comes without effort. I'm here to tell you it will be <em>worth it.</em></p>
