    <h1>Principles of Heroism</h1>
    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <div class="quote">
    	<p>You could settle for an ordinary life. Or do you feel like you were meant for something better?</p>
    	<p>Something special?</p>
    	<div class="attribution">Captain Christopher Pike, <em>Star Trek</em></div>
    <p>I love stories of heroism. I think most people do. The daring plan, the desperate final battle, the last-minute turnaround just when all seems lost--all that. These story elements remind us that what seems impossible might just be doable if the right people are willing to commit to it.</p>
    <p>Heroes are hard to find, almost by definition. But they never go away; every era has had its heroes. They never go away because the <em>need</em> for them never goes away. Entropy never gives up, and neither do those who serve it, so new heroes must arise or evil will prevail.</p>
    <p>This is no less true today than it was in King Arthur's time. <strong>Our world needs heroes</strong>--men and women of proven good character who are willing to put others' well-being above their own.</p>
    <p>I've decided to become one of these people. What follows is a set of principles I've developed to help me along the way. It's posted here for anyone who decides to follow the same path.</p>
    <p>It took me a long time to figure out the role of the hero in modern society. When knights in shining armor first appeared, their garb was supremely practical, because brigands were threatening the innocents of the land, and the knights' job was to cut them down in personal combat. The idealized gunslingers of the Old West performed the same task. Today, conflicts are won not with swords or guns but with words, ideas, and hard work. The nature of the conflict has changed: In most areas, evil no longer threatens our bodies, so we turn instead to defeating the evil inside ourselves and encouraging others to do the same.</p>
    <h3>1. You Get Skill Points For Everything</h3>
    <p>Role-playing games have taught me a lot about heroism. One of their most important lessons is that you are in control of what kind of person you are. This is modeled with a simple rule: <strong>Whenever you do something, you get better at doing that thing.</strong></p>
    <p><em>So,</em> you think, <em>practice makes perfect?</em> Yes, but there's more to it than that. Everything you do gets you skill points in that activity <em>whether you want them or not,</em> and there's an <em>opportunity cost</em> when you choose to do one thing instead of another. Cheating, manipulating people, even whiling your time away doing nothing--all of these are activities you can sink skill points into. Skill points that probably could have been better spent elsewhere. Every one of us probably has a few skill points we wish we could re-spend.</p>
    <p>We can't get those points back, but the good news is your supply of skill points is limited only by your lifespan. There are a <em>lot</em> of things you can get good at, and you have lots of time to learn. Just be intentional about which skills you're earning points in. If there are two approaches to a problem, take the one that will give you the kind of skill points you want.</p>
    <h3>2. Life Is Conflict</h3>
    <p>If you don't want to live your life hiding from every problem that comes your way, you're going to need to spend some points in skills that will help you overcome those problems. When those problems show up, don't avoid them--<strong>confront</strong> the problems, overcome them, and take the skill points they grant. This is how you level up into a more capable person.</p>
    <p>Be warned: your obstacles will fight dirty. There are forces at work which would like you to remain downtrodden and powerless. Attempting to better yourself practically guarantees that resistance will materialize. You <strong>must</strong> push through it. Don't flinch when something makes you uncomfortable. Learn to recognize fear and overcome it. Accept pain when it leads to something good. Life and freedom await you on the other side.</p>
    <p>I'm not here to tell you it will be easy. It's not meant to be. Challenging ourselves by overcoming adversity is how character growth works. Nothing truly valuable comes without effort. I'm here to tell you it will be <em>worth it.</em></p>
    <p>The struggle will be long and hard, so pick your battles. You cannot be strong in everything. Decide which issues are really important to you and attack them relentlessly; let the unimportant stuff slide. Sometimes the most honest answer is "I don't know" or "I don't really care."</p>
    <h3>3. Honesty Is Fundamental</h3>
    <p>The hardest villains to defeat are the ones that live inside you. If you're serious about improving your character, start by being brutally honest with yourself about your own thoughts and actions. You still need to be able to forgive yourself when you screw up, but you have to acknowledge your own character flaws before you can get to work on fixing them.</p>
    <p>Seek out and expose every lie that's taken root in your life. Think carefully about the things that others tell you are true, and be especially careful about the things you tell yourself. Be wary of easy answers. Reexamine conclusions that favor you and yours. Think about the side of the story you're not being told.</p>
    <p>The most harmful lies are the ones we tell ourselves. We use these lies to make ourselves more comfortable. Lies like "it's hopeless; there's no point in doing anything," or "[those people I don't get along with] are [stupid/crazy/evil]", or "[thing I did/might do] is OK because [justification]." Telling ourselves these things is much simpler than grappling with the real world in all its nasty complexity, so we just make up something that seems to make sense and move on. But living inside a ball of comfy lies is a small, miserable existence. If you want a powerful, joyful life you can be proud of, you're gonna have to take off the velvet gloves and develop some calluses.</p>
    <h3>4. Embrace Complexity</h3>
    <p>The human brain is marvelously good at finding patterns. It's one of the few information-processing tasks we're still better at than computers. Our brains are such apt pattern-finders that we often seem to find patterns where none actually exist, and we get emotionally attached to patterns we consider desirable. This is a big root cause of faulty and often hurtful thinking.</p>
	<p>On some deep, instictual level, humans <em>really</em> want to believe the world makes sense. And not just on a broad scale; everything that happens needs to fit into some meaningful narrative, or we feel that something is wrong. This is where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> comes from, along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming">victim blaming</a> and other fallacies.</p>
	<p>Every person carries a tiny, emotional model of the universe inside their head. This model is a big part of who they are. Because the universe is big and complicated, we tend to simplify our models, and that can get us into trouble.</p>
	<div>Pick the group you like the least: [Democrats] [Republicans] [Gays] [Cisgenders] [Men] [Women] [The rich] [The poor] [Cats]</div>
	<p>Let's say you're watching TV and someone says or does something outrageous. (On TV, this happens a lot.) As part of processing this, you probably consider the source: Is this person a man or woman? Shabby or well-dressed? Democrat or Republican? Gay or straight? You analyze every category this person fits into and then adjust your opinion of those groups based on this person's behavior.</p>
	<p>But here's the problem: When you adjust your opinion of everyone in group X based on the actions of one person, your mental model of that group is probably not getting closer to reality. They didn't <em>all</em> do that thing; only one of them did. But you're not really viewing them as individual people; you're too far away for that. So you mash what you know about all Democrats into one big Proto-Democrat in your head and ascribe the actions of every Democrat you know to that person.</p>
	<p>Problem is, Democrats are a big group. They don't all agree with each other; often they work at cross-purposes. So when you mash all their actions together, the result is an incoherent mess. The only way to make sense of the result is to declare that Democrats are crazy.</p>
	<p>Spoiler alert: They're not crazy. Your mental model is wrong. The members of that group are individuals, not a collective; each of their actions seems quite reasonable from their perspective.</p>
	<p>So be careful about generalizing people into groups, and especially about any pejoratives you assign to those groups. When you get angry at [group], unless you know the people in that group very well, the thing you are angry at may have only a faint resemblance to the reality.</p>
	<h3>Default to Kindness; Practice Love</h3>
	<p>John 13:34 - "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another." This is Jesus' most difficult command. Loving someone when they're being nice to you is easy; true love is loving someone when they drive you nuts. Love is a skill that must be developed like anything else. Look for opportunities to level up your love. A boss fight is coming, and you don't want to be underleveled when that day comes.</p>
	<p>There will be situations where you simply don't have it in you to be loving to the people around you. If you can't be loving, settle for being kind. Remember that everyone is fighting their own difficult battles, and you know very little about what others' lives are like. Your words have power, so use them responsibly. Criticize constructively or not at all.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>This is our everyday epic: The good within us against the evil, our love overcoming our hate, driving ourselves to keep getting better. The choice is yours: Will you be a protagonist or a background character?</p>
