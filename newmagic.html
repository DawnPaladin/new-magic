    	<p>You could settle for... an ordinary life. Or do you feel like you were meant for something better?</p>
    	<p>Something special?</p>

    <p>I love stories of heroism. I think most people do. The daring plan, the desperate final battle, the last-minute turnaround just when all seems lost--all that. These story elements remind us that what seems impossible might just be doable if the right people are willing to commit to it.</p>
    <p>Heroes are hard to find, almost by definition. But they never go away; every era has had its heroes. They never go away because the <em>need</em> for them never goes away. Entropy never gives up, and neither do those who serve it, so new heroes must arise or evil will prevail.</p>
    <p>This is no less true today than it was in King Arthur's time. <strong>Our world needs heroes</strong>--men and women of proven good character who are willing to put others' well-being above their own.</p>
    <p>I've decided to become one of these people. What follows is a set of principles I've developed to help me along the way.</p>
    <h2>1. Life Is Conflict</h2>
    <p>It took me a long time to figure out the role of the hero in modern society. When knights in shining armor first appeared, their garb was supremely practical, because brigands were threatening the innocents of the land, and the knights' job was to cut them down in personal combat. The idealized gunslingers of the Old West performed the same task. Today, conflicts are won not with swords or guns but with words, ideas, and hard work. The nature of the conflict has changed: In most areas, evil no longer threatens our bodies, so we turn instead to defeating the evil inside ourselves.</p>
